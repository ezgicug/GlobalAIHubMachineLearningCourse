    "2) Supervised learning is the machine learning task of  inferring a function from the training "labeled" dataset.We have input variables and an output variable,and the goal of supervised learning is to use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from the input to the output.However, unsupervised Learning is a machine learning task to describe the structure of the data without using explicitly-provided labels, and we only have input data and no corresponding output variables.\n",
